# About Me 
I am a mechanician who enjoys solving challenging problems in the field of mechanical engineering by employing computational tools and then validating results with experiments. I did my Masters of Science (MS) from Arizona State University under the tutelage of Dr. Dhruv Bhate as a member of the [3DX Research Group](https://3dxresearch.com/) I am currently looking of for an advisor to get a Ph.D. under, who shares my research interests and passion for solving such problems. I am targeting admission for the Spring/Fall 2021 semesters.

# Research Interests
1. Structural Computational Mechanics
2. Design Optimization
3. Additive Manufacturing
4. Mechanical Metamaterial Design

# Skills
1. Non-Linear Finite Element Analysis
2. Topology Optimization
3. Lattice Structural Design
4. C++ Programming
5. MATLAB Programming
6. Python Programming
7. GNU/Linux Operating System
